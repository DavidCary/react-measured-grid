# Demo 1B: React-Virtualized Grid

As a point of comparison, this directory provides a parallel demo using the `Grid` component from [`react-virtualized`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) package.

Scrolling backwards over rows that have not been previously displayed is typically much jerkier in this demo than in [Demo 1](../demo1/README.md).


You can use the inputs in the demo to:

  - Change the number of rows in the grid.
  - Reposition the grid to make a cell visible.
  - Manually scroll horizontally and vertically.
