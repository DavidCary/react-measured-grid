# Demo 1C: Full, Static Grid

As a point of comparison, this directory provides a parallel demo using 
just plain, static, fully rendered HTML, without using React or virtualization.


Initial display of the data with larger numbers of rows
typically takes longer and requires more memory
than in [Demo 1](../demo1/README.md).


You can use the inputs in the demo to:

  - Change the number of rows in the grid.
  - Change the width of the first quote, using CSS in a dynamic style element.
  - Reposition the grid vertically to make a row visible.
  - Manually scroll horizontally and vertically.
  - Resize the view window.
